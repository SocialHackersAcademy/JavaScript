# JavaScript!
Here we learn JavaScript, starting from scratch and moving on to more advanced concepts.  

## Module #2 - [JavaScript1](https://github.com/SocialHackersCodeSchool/JavaScript1/)

![JavaScript1](./assets/javascript1.png)

In this module you'll make a start into the wonderful world of programming. We will be using the programming language JavaScript to do so. You'll learn about the basic building blocks of programming: `loops`, `functions`, `control flow` and more. Consider these as the ABC's of programming, without them it's impossible to write working software!

### **Module goals**

By the end of this module, students should have a familiarity with and basic understanding of the following:

- Have an idea of what `computer programming` is
- Know the basic building blocks of `JavaScript`
- Correctly write and use `variables`, `functions` and `loops`
- Understand the `control flow`
- Think like a programmer

## Module #3 - [JavaScript2](https://github.com/SocialHackersCodeSchool/JavaScript2)

![JavaScript2](./assets/javascript2.png)

In **JavaScript2** you'll learn all about how to use JavaScript within the browser. First, you'll learn about how HTML is structured within your browser: we call this the `Document Object Model` (DOM). Once you've gotten the hang of that we'll apply JavaScript to it, in order to manipulate the elements and make our pages more interactive. We call this `DOM manipulation` and it's one of the most interesting things about JavaScript!

### **Module goals for JavaScript2**

In order to successfully complete this module you will need to master the following:

- Understand what the `Document Object Model` (DOM) is
- Use the basics of `DOM Manipulation`
- Differentiate between `synchronous` and `asynchronous` operations
- Gain awareness of the inner workings of JavaScript
- Learn to think based on principles, instead of libraries and frameworks

## Module #4 - [JavaScript3](https://github.com/SocialHackersCodeSchool/JavaScript3)

![JavaScript3](./assets/javascript3.png)

A big part of being a programmer means moving data from one place to another. It also means working with other people's software. In this module you'll be learning about one of the core things of what makes a web developer: working with APIs!

On top of that you'll also learn how to think differently about how you write your programs. Like in any field, once you've mastered a particular way of doing things you start thinking about how it could be done differently. In programming we call these `paradigms` and in this module you'll learn one such paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming!
